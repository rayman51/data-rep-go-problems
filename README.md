# data-rep-go-problems

My name is Ray Mannion and I am a 3rd student at the Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology studying Software Development

In this repository you wiil find problems I was asked to complete for a data representation and query module.
The problems are done using the Go programming language, which I am currently learning.

In order for you to run these programs you will need to install the GO compiler on your computer.
