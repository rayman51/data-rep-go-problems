# data-rep-go-problems

## Intro
My name is Ray Mannion and I am a 3rd student at the Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology studying Software Development

In this repository you wiil find problems I was asked to complete for a data representation and query module.
The [problems](https://data-representation.github.io/problems/go-fundamentals.html) are done using the Go programming language, which I am currently learning.

In order for you to run these programs you will need to install the [GO](https://www.google.ie/?gws_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=SQvUWejfHOaXgAaL3JeoBA)
compiler on your computer.

## Problems
The Ten programs are
1. Hello World
2. Time Date
3. FizzBuzz
4. Factorial
5. Guessing game
6. High Low
7. Palindrome
8. Merge Sort 
9. Newton Square Root
10. ReverseString
