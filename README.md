# data-rep-go-problems

## Intro
My name is Ray Mannion and I am a 3rd student at the Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology studying Software Development

In this repository you wiil find problems I was asked to complete for a data representation and query module.
The [problems](https://data-representation.github.io/problems/go-fundamentals.html) are done using the Go programming language, which I am currently learning.

In order for you to run these programs you will need to install the [GO](https://www.google.ie/?gws_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=SQvUWejfHOaXgAaL3JeoBA)

2. Time Date
3. FizzBuzz
4. Factorial
5. Guessing game
6. High Low
7. Palindrome
8. Merge Sort
